## Overview
For this project, I will use data cleaning, imputation, analysis and vizualisation to generate insighs for my company. It now sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. I am charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. I must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of my company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Business Understanding
In recent years, major tech and media companies have entered the film production industry by developing original video content to attract audiences and boost their platforms. Inspired by their success, my company plans to launch its own movie studio. However, as newcomers to the entertainment business, we lack data-driven knowledge about what types of films perform well at the box office.

The core business question is: "What kinds of movies generate the most revenue, popularity, and critical success in today’s market?" To answer this, we must explore historical data from various movie industry sources to identify patterns, trends, and key factors that contribute to box office success. The ultimate goal is to generate actionable insights that will guide studio executives in deciding the genres, budgets, and attributes of the films they should invest in.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the datasets, we identified several key insights to guide our company’s entry into the film production industry. The most financially successful films combine strong domestic and international performance, with animated, action, and adventure genres consistently appearing among the top-grossing titles. Studios such as Buena Vista (Disney) and Warner Bros lead the industry with the highest average global revenues, indicating the strategic value of genre selection, strong branding, and international marketability. Overall, these findings suggest that beginning with mid-budget, globally appealing genres such as family-friendly animation or thrillers offers a promising pathway into the competitive movie market.

## Next Step
To build on the insights of this analysis and support informed investment in the cinematography industry we have to follow some steps:

Invest in State-of-the-Art Equipment Hubs and Rental Houses: Create or incentivize the establishment of well-stocked, modern equipment rental houses. Develop a Robust Local Talent Incubation and Retention Program. Establish specialized academies or partnerships with film schools focused on cinematography

Foster International Co-Production Partnerships and Knowledge Exchange: Actively seek out opportunities for co-productions with countries that have mature film industries. This provides crucial funding, allows local cinematographers and crew to work alongside international teams, learning best practices and advanced techniques.

Develop a good relation with good writers and experimented directors
